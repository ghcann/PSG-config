# PSG-config
A configuration file generator for NASA's Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) Application Programming Interface (API).The aim of this work is to pass on a small bit of code that the author has found useful whilst using NASA's Planetary Spectrum generator.

# Run 
The notebook NASA-PSG-config.ipynb should be modified to your own problem. This was developed for ESA's ExoMars_NOMAD-SO instrument, to enable comparison between developed radiative transfer models.
